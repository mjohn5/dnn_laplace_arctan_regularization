# dnn_laplace_arctan_regularization

Sample codes (developed by Sujit Vettam) used for https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05142.pdf
are posted here.

Currently, the folder contains CNN codes used for CIFAR-10 dataset with arctan (gamma = 100) regularization. Other regularizations can be done by changing the numbers for the 'regtype' command
